![Badge: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-blue.svg)

## Description

This project implements a Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline using GitHub Actions for a full-stack web application. The CI pipeline automatically runs Cypress component tests whenever a pull request is made to the `develop` branch, ensuring that all code integrates cleanly and meets the required quality standards. The CD pipeline triggers automatic deployment to Render when changes are merged from the `develop` branch to the `main` branch, ensuring that the application is always up-to-date with the latest features and improvements in production.
